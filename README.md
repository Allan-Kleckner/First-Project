API

I used Yahoo Finance through Rapid API. I got completely stuck in this area. Initially I wasn't reaching the API at all because of 403 and 405 errors. I finally worked it out last night by simply clearing my cache in my browser. I was able to show that I my search function was working in console. I couldn't get that search to interact with the API in a way that returned the data I wanted.
